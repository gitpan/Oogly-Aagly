Oogly-Aagly - A form building, processing and data validation system!

Oogly-Aagly is basically form building on top of the Oogly data validation
framework. This means that existing packages and code using Oogly can be easily
converted to utilize this new functionality.

The following is an example of that...

    use MyApp::FormFu;
    my $form = MyApp::FormFu->new(\%params);
    my @flds = qw/search/;
    if ($form->validate(@flds)){
        ...
    }
    else {
	print $form->render('form_name', '/url', @flds);
    }

    package MyApp::FormFu;
    use Oogly::Aagly;

    # cpan and see Oogly for all the gritty details ...
    field 'search' => {
        label => 'user search',
        error => 'your search must contain a valid id number',
	element => {
	    type => 'input',
	    template => ''
	},
        validation => sub {
            my ($form, $field, $params) = @_;
            $form->error($field, $field->{error})
                if $field->{value} =~ /\D/;
        }
    };
